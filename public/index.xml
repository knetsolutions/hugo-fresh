      <description>1. To check the mininet version mn --version  2. To clean up the existing ovs bridges and namespaces Note: sometime we mistakenly closed the mininet shell, or mininet crashed. But the topology components will continue to exists. To clean such stuff, cleanup command is used.</description>

      <description>1. Introduction Generally we use mininet to simulate the topology in a single system/computer/virutal machine. The System resources limits our topology size.
Suppose, we want to build the large topology with 1000s of switches and nodes. We cannot build this topology in single system. The solution is, we can build the subset of the topology in mulitiple systems and connect each other system via GRE Tunnel.</description>

      <description>1. Introduction We provides training and guidance to complete your SDN Project. we have guided students across the Globe. We have studends in India ( from Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, kolkatta, delhi, mumbai), and other countries (malaysia, germany, france, brazil, united states, pakistan, egypt, yemen, saudi arabia, united kingdom, etc)
we work online and conducts project training in gotomeeting. so no restriction on geographical location.

      <description>1. Addressing the Flow table fullfill(flow table exhaust) issue In Hardware Openflow switches, Flow table suffers from the limited storage due to the use of TCAM â€” on which the flow table is realized in the majority of existing equipments in industry to achieve fast forwarding. As a result, after the flow table is full filled, the switch behavior is unexpected on both forwarding and control plane.
The reason of the fast flow entry occupation is due to the fine-grained flow entry storage of SDN.</description>

      <title>Testing IPv6 in Mininet</title>

      <description>1. Introduction Generally we use IPv4 in all our networking devices/environment/test bed. But Some special cases requires IPv6 address. There are plenty of resources available in the internet for Mininet with IPv4.
In this blog, we discuss about using the IPv6 addresses in the Mininet Topology. We also discuss about, How to do Ping and TCP, UDP Traffic Tests (IPerf) with IPv6 addresses.
Some basic concepts of IPv6 addresses
A. IPv6 Link Local Address Link-local address is a IPv6 unicast address that is valid only for communications within the network segment (link) or the broadcast domain.</description>
